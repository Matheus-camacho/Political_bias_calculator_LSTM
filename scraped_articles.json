public could be put at risk if the UK leaves the EU in March without an official agreement, the UK's most senior police officer has said.\n\nMet Commissioner Cressida Dick said a no-deal exit would threaten access to EU-wide criminal databases and make it harder to extradite people from abroad.\n\nShe told the BBC the Met was talking to other police forces across Europe about contingency arrangements if needed.\n\nParliament will vote on the UK's proposed withdrawal deal next month.\n\nThe UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019.\n\nThe agreement negotiated by Theresa May with the EU - which sets the terms of the UK's exit and a declaration on future relations - will only come into force if MPs approve it.\n\nThe prime minister has said she wants the UK to have the most comprehensive security partnership with the EU of any country outside the bloc.\n\nAfter Brexit, the UK will cease to be a member of law enforcement agencies Europol and Eurojust, and will no longer be a member of the European Arrest Warrant scheme, which enables EU nations to fast-track the extradition of criminal suspects.\n\nThe agreement on future relations commits the two sides to putting in place reciprocal arrangements to try and match existing law enforcement and judicial co-operation.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser Your guide to Brexit jargon Enter the word or phrase you are looking for Search\n\nThe priority areas for future law enforcement co-operation include the exchange of data such as DNA, fingerprints, passenger records, wanted alerts, and vehicle registrations.\n\nThe EU needs the UK in many of these areas, but the document is not legally binding and also makes clear that there is a variety of technical issues to be overcome.\n\n'Slower and costlier'\n\nMs Dick told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK's policing co-operation with the EU was based on a framework of \"legal instruments\" which would have to be replaced after its exit.\n\nWhile she hoped the two sides would end up with \"something very similar\", she accepted that if the UK left without a deal, this would be \"very difficult to do short term\".\n\n\"We will have to replace some of the things we currently use in terms of access to databases, the way in which we can quickly arrest and extradite people, these kinds of things, we'll have to replace as effectively as we can.\n\n\"That will be more costly, undoubtedly, slower, undoubtedly and, potentially, yes, put the public at risk.\"\n\nThe Metropolitan Police, she said, was working with other UK forces to determine how best to maintain European co-operation after Brexit.\n\nShe also disclosed that she was taking to European counterparts on a country-by country basis about contingency plans needed to maintain co-operation, if this became necessary.\n\n\"We can talk about how they may happen but while so much is unknown, nothing can be put in place and it would be improper to do so,\" she said.\n\n\"But we can talk with our colleagues and indeed I and my senior colleagues across policing are doing that all the time.\"\n\n'Mutually beneficial'\n\nMs Dick's comments were welcomed by opponents of Brexit, with Mayor of London Sadiq Khan saying the public should be given the final say in another referendum to stop the UK \"crashing out\" of the EU.\n\nBut campaign group Stand Up 4 Brexit, which opposes Mrs May's deal, said it would be \"mutually beneficial\" for the UK and EU to respect existing security arrangements until deciding on what replaces them.\n\nThe organisation, which says it has the backing of more than 50 Conservative MPs, said it was \"very confident\" that bilateral agreements could be agreed once the UK left.\n\n\"Cressida Dick accepted that they are already discussing arrangements so it can be put in place quickly,\" its director Rebecca Ryan said.\n\nThe Home Office said it had proposed an ambitious and legally-binding agreement on internal security as part of the withdrawal deal but the UK had to be prepared for all eventualities.\n\n\"The Home Office is working intensively with operational partners and others to ensure we are ready to make best use of the alternative channels with member states, should we exit without a deal,\" a spokesperson said, adding that the National Police Chiefs' Council was working with individual UK forces on how to manage this.\n\nIn the BBC interview, Ms Dick also defended the police response to the drone disruption at Gatwick Airport, which shut the UK's second largest airport for more than 36 hours last week and ruined the Christmas plans of thousands of holidaymakers.\n\nShe said the Met was supporting Sussex Police in investigating what was a \"serious crime\" and suggested whoever was ultimately found to be responsible would \"undoubtedly face a prison sentence\".\n\nThe authorities faced a \"difficult challenge\" in working out what had happened and there would have to be much closer working between the

We\u2019re definitely talking about justice being denied as a result of Laspo.\n\nQuick guide Legal aid cuts Show Hide What are the legal aid cuts affecting England and Wales? The Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (Laspo) Act of 2012 was not just a bureaucratic mouthful: it was a huge piece of austerity that many thousands of people in England and Wales have found hard to swallow.\n\nThe cuts in central government funding have amounted to about \u00a3950m a year in real terms. As a result, the number of people receiving legal assistance in civil (not criminal) cases has fallen by more than 80%.\n\nWho qualifies for legal aid now? Anyone earning as little as \u00a323,000 a year is no longer entitled to any legal aid in lower court cases. For more serious Crown Court cases, the threshold is \u00a337,000.\n\nEven if you get legal aid, you may have to pay 'contributions', which can escalate over the course of a case. For those who get no legal aid at all, private legal fees can run to tens or hundreds of thousands of pounds.\n\nAround 140,000 people received legal aid in 2017/18, compared to 785,000 in 2010/11.\n\nWhat is the impact of this? The courts are now full of large numbers of people who have to defend themselves. They are known as 'litigants in person' and many find the byzantine court system and procedures disconcerting and unfamiliar at best, and impenetrable and stressful at worst.\n\nSome may lose their case because they are inadequately represented. Some may even get longer jail terms because they have no lawyer to advise them how to plea.\n\nIn some cases, antagonists in a domestic dispute, divorce or custody battle will have to confront each other directly in court, rather than through their lawyers.\n\nPhotograph: Matthew Cooper/PA\n\n\u201cMy experience of being falsely accused, and losing my life savings to defend myself proving that, was a road to Damascus moment for me. I\u2019m a changed person now, in terms of Laspo and sympathy for all those who now have to go through the legal system without expert help, support and advice.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019m not just talking about those accused in the criminal courts like me, but everyone affected by Laspo. Parents going through the family courts, tenants fighting landlords, patients fighting hospitals and so on. Laspo is clearly not working. It needs to be overhauled.\u201d\n\nEvans, who was in the Speaker\u2019s chair when the legislation was debated, was caught out on costs because Laspo changed the rules for acquitted defendants. Previously, they were eligible to claim for \u201creasonable costs\u201d. After Laspo they were allowed to claim only a modest contribution towards the costs they had incurred.\n\n\u201cLaspo financially punishes innocent people for the crime of being wrongly accused,\u201d Evans said.\n\nThe case against Evans fell apart as his accusers took their turns in the witness box during the five-week trial. Several of the young men told the judge at Preston crown court that they did not consider themselves to be victims of a criminal offence and had not wanted to complain to police.\n\nStrain of legal aid cuts shows in family, housing and immigration courts Read more\n\nEvans now believes that people who are taken to court by the Crown Prosecution Service and acquitted should get back their reasonable costs. Prior to Laspo, defendant\u2019s costs orders (DCOs) ensured this was available to all who had paid privately. Those rights were abolished by schedule 7 of Laspo.\n\n\u201cYou have no choice, when you\u2019re accused of a crime and risk going to prison and losing everything, than to pay whatever you can to defend yourself,\u201d Evans said. \u201cI was fortunate that I had my grandfather\u2019s business in Swansea that I could sell and a house that I could remortgage. But if you don\u2019t have life savings that you can drain, it makes a mockery of the whole idea of justice.\n\n\u201cThanks to Laspo, you can be taken to court through no fault of your own and even when you walk away without a stain on your character, your bank account is completely drained. They call it the \u2018innocent tax\u2019 but what it is is innocent people subsidising the judiciary \u2026 We should go back to the pre-Laspo rules.\u201d\n\nHe initially supported Laspo for the same reasons he thinks the public have not protested against the legislation: \u201cPeople don\u2019t see people like me as victims, and there\u2019s a sense that it could not happen to them.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought too, but it\u2019s completely wrong. There\u2019s nothing easier than someone falsely accusing you of a crime. Maybe only a relatively small number of people are affected, but part of the problem is that there\u2019s a randomness to being falsely accused, it could literally happen to everyone.\n\n\u201cI was lucky, in that I had life savings to lose, but for those who don\u2019t, Laspo can bring them to the point of suicide.\u201d\n\nHe is calling for an independent commission to investigate equality in the legal system. \u201cWe must have equality for those who are now forced to go to court and represent themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nLegal aid: how has it changed in 70 years? Read more\n\nDefendants who do apply for legal aid representation find themselves relying on a desperately underfunded service. Christina Blacklaws, the president of the Law Society, which represents solicitors in England and Wales, said: \u201cDefence solicitors have had no pay rises for over 20 years and this is driving more and more of them away from criminal defence work.\n\n\u201cThere is a desperate need to increase fees for all of this other work [including visits to police stations] if we are to have any hope of avoiding the imminent extinction of the criminal defence solicitor in some parts of the country.\u201d\n\nA report by Donald Hirsch, professor of social policy at Loughborough University, for the Law Society highlighted the fact that some of the poorest people were being denied legal aid because they could not afford the financial contributions they were required to make, which can be up to \u00a38,000.\n\nMark Smith, a duty solicitor at the law firm DJMS, said: \u201cIf they [are deemed to be] over the contribution threshold, the amount they have to pay is astronomical. If you paid for it privately, it would cost far less. Sometimes people on benefits are told they have to pay. We are seeing more people unrepresented in crown court cases.\u201d", "Afghanistan women\u2019s national team players have made detailed allegations to the Guardian of sexual and physical abuse they say they suffered at the hands of the president of the football federation, Keramuudin Karim.\n\nAfghan FA abuse claims: president demands \u2018thorough investigation\u2019 Read more\n\nThe players, who say they are speaking anonymously because of fears for their or their families\u2019 safety, have made claims ranging from serious sexual and physical assault to harassment and threats to themselves or family members from Karim.\n\nOne said Karim put a gun to her head after he punched her in the face and sexually assaulted her in a hidden bedroom accessed from his office, threatening to shoot her and her family if she spoke to the media.\n\nAnother claimed Karim threatened, in front of her teammates at training, to cut her tongue after she ran off when being sexually assaulted, and then attempted to remove her clothes on another occasion.\n\nA third player alleged that Karim tried to kiss her neck and lips and that after she ran from the room she was dropped from the national squad and accused of being a lesbian. One of the other players also claims Karim spread a rumour that she was a lesbian.\n\nAn investigation was launched and Karim and four other members of the federation (AFF) were suspended by the Attorney General\u2019s Office in Afghanistan, after the Guardian in November published allegations of abuse. Fifa said it was looking into the claims and suspended Karim two weeks ago for 90 days \u201cwhich may be extended pending proceedings\u201d.\n\nAll the allegations have been put by the Guardian to Karim, who has not responded to requests for comment.\n\nOne player said she was targeted after training when going to Karim\u2019s office to ask for money to cover transport costs. \u201cI asked for help. He started trying to come closer to me. He said: \u2018I want to come closer to you, I want to see your body.\u2019\n\n\u201cI tried to ignore him, I was very polite to him. I said: \u2018Listen, I need money for my transportation, I don\u2019t have money. Can you help me? If you can\u2019t, please let me go.\u2019 He said he would help me and told me to wait. I said I wanted to go home. He said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry, I will give you money.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe president told me to follow him to the next room. So I went with him. I thought he was going to help me. I followed him into the next room. He went into another room and there was another room off that which was very dark. Inside that room there was a door. But you can\u2019t see the door; it looks like the wall, it is hard to see it\u2019s a door. It was open. In there it was like a hotel room, a bedroom with everything inside and a bathroom. He told me to go in. I went in, he was behind me and he locked the door.\n\n\u201cHe told me to sit on the bed. I was worried, I was shaking. He said: \u2018Today I want to find out what is behind your clothes.\u2019 I was telling him: \u2018Leave me alone, I want to go home.\u2019 I stood up and I said I wanted to go home and he said to me: \u2018Scream as much as you want, there won\u2019t be anyone hearing you, they can\u2019t hear you.\u2019\n\n\u201cThen he started pushing me towards the bed. I stood up again. I said: \u2018Leave me alone, I only came for support, I don\u2019t want it any more, please leave me alone, let me go.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe was telling me \u2026 that today he would find out if I was a lesbian or not \u2013 because I was with girls a lot and I looked a little like a boy.\n\n\u201cI stood up and tried to fight, but he punched me in the face. I fell on to the bed. I tried to rise and go to the door but because the door used his fingerprint it was not possible to open it without his fingerprint. So I couldn\u2019t get out. He punched me on the face and on my mouth. Blood was coming from my nose and lips. He started beating me, I fell on to the bed, and everything went dark \u2026\n\n\u201cWhen I woke up, all my clothes were gone and there was blood everywhere. I was shaking, I didn\u2019t know what happened to me. The bed was covered in blood, blood was coming from my mouth, nose and vagina. I went to the bathroom. I washed my face and put my clothes on. I went back and said: \u2018I will go like this and I will tell the media what happened to me.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe took a gun, his gun, put it on my head and said: \u2018See what I have done to you? I can shoot you in the head and everywhere will be your brain. And I can do the same with your family. If you want your family to be alive you should keep quiet.\u2019\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, has said he \u2018wants the attorney general to investigate this thoroughly\u2019. He added: \u2018I cannot tolerate immorality.\u2019 Photograph: Mohammad Ismail/Reuters\n\n\u201cThen he threw money at my face and told me to take it and get out. He said he didn\u2019t want to see my face. He opened the door and I left.\u201d\n\nUnable to tell her family what had happened, she made up a sporting injury. \u201cI did not feel well. I found out through friends in the team that the president had spread a rumour that I was a lesbian and that he had caught me with another girl and that is why I was kicked out. That was depressing for me and very dangerous for me.\u201d\n\nHer decision to speak out is not without risk. \u201cI know that my family is in danger and I know they will be when more comes out. But I want to stand and speak about it because of the future of girls. I want girls to have a safe environment.\u201d\n\nShe said Karim\u2019s behaviour was widely known inside and outside the squad. \u201cIt became acceptable around women\u2019s football, his behaviour.\u201d\n\nWhy was it not reported to the authorities? \u201cHe has huge power inside the system and inside the government,\u201d she said of Karim, a former governor of Panjshir province and chief of staff in the ministry of defence before he took over the presidency of the AFF in 2004. \u201cNo one can stand up against him because he is so powerful \u2026 Today the girls can\u2019t raise their voice because they are afraid. They can get killed.\u201d\n\nA second player said she was asked to go to Karim\u2019s office by a member of the federation. \u201cI was not aware of his character,\u201d she said. She claims Karim sat with her on a sofa. \u201cHe started talking and flirting with me. He started touching my body and then he tried to kiss me. I started crying, I was scared and I was panicking, I was trying to push him away.\u201d\n\nShe says she screamed, attacked him and was able to escape his grasp. For one month, she says, she hid. \u201cI was feeling so weak and I couldn\u2019t share my story. At the same time I was receiving phone calls from the federation and especially from the president, pushing me, pressuring me to come back because it was destroying his image.\u201d\n\nShe returned but, she says, her ordeal was far from over. \u201cThe president, whenever I was going to training, was coming on to the pitch and in front of everyone saying I was not polite, I talked a lot, and was directly threatening me, saying he would cut my tongue to silence me. He was non-stop abusing me and harassing me.\u201d\n\nOne day she says she was early for training at the federation. \u201cI was sitting on the benches waiting for the rest of the team. He saw I was there on the security cameras. He started calling me on the phone. I was ignoring it so he came out himself and told me to come. I had to follow him, there was nothing I could do. I had to cross four doors \u2013 he had gone ahead and had me on the phone giving me instructions of where to go.\n\n\u201cAfter the four doors I was in a bedroom. It was like a five-star hotel with a mirror, modern furniture, a bed, women\u2019s stuff, perfumes and stuff on the drawers. When I got there and saw that I started recalling the stories I had heard \u2026 I was scared and I started crying, I thought it was the end of my life.\n\n\u201cThe president was naked and was on the bed waiting for me. When I started crying he got up and ran towards me and held me and was trying to pull my scarf and dress away. He was attacking and tearing at my dress. I was crying, I was screaming, I was struggling. I was very lucky. He received a phone call; I started screaming, he pushed me away and tried to silence me but I didn\u2019t stop screaming. He had no choice then and he opened the door. When he opened the door I ran.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Afghanistan women\u2019s football.

The car landed on a riverbank.\n\nAdolf Erlingsson, a tour guide who was among the first on the scene, said: \u201cIt was horrible. The car seemed to have hit the ground many metres from where it stopped. We struggled getting everyone out.\u201d\n\nErlingsson estimated that the car had fallen about five or six metres from the bridge and said it was a \u201ctotal wreck\u201d when he arrived at the scene.\n\n\u201cThe driver must have lost control somehow and it went through the railing,\u201d said Erlingsson, a former broadcaster.

It was just about freezing, but I didn\u2019t detect any ice on the road,\u201d he said. Erlingsson described how he and others had to cut the driver out of the wreckage using a winch from another vehicle. \u201cThe driver was alive and trapped more or less under the dashboard. We were trying to get the people out of the car and helping them. It was a very difficult situation.\u201d\n\nHe said three people were trapped in the car when he arrived and he believed that two of them were dead.

She said she had assumed he was still there until police contacted her to say he had been found dead on Wednesday.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS trust, which runs North Manchester General, said: \u201cThe trust were sorry to hear of the death of Mr Anthony Lawless and will work closely with the police and coroner\u2019s office to help ascertain the circumstances leading up to this tragic event. Our thoughts are with his family at this sad time.\u201d\n\nPolice were called to an area of the canal near Redhill Road in Ancoats shortly after 9am after a report of a body in the water. Lawless usually slept rough in Harpurhey, north Manchester, and his sister said she was surprised to learn he was found 2.5 miles (4km) away in the city centre.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we don\u2019t understand; how did he make it from north Manchester to there, when he had no money?\u201d said Brennan. \u201cI said: why the heck did they let him out knowing he was falling down?\u201d\n\nShe said he began drinking after the death of their father. \u201cWhen the drink took hold of him he changed, but other than that he was all right. Everyone who knew him said he was very, very polite. He was lovely,\u201d she said.\n\nAn estimated 50 homeless people died in Greater Manchester last year, up from 21 in 2013 and more than any other combined authority in England, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed just before Christmas.

We must hear the struggle of these people and try to prevent other casualties,\u201d he said.\n\nIn his 2017 election manifesto, Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, pledged to end rough sleeping in the region by 2020.

It\u2019s a fundamental thing about what constitutes a successful life \u2026\n\n\u201cA good question for all of us to think about is: what would the world look like if I hadn\u2019t existed? If you can think: \u2018I made the world a better place\u2019 then that is what it\u2019s all about.\u201d\n\nThe latest figures show disorders are much more common among boys than girls from the age of two to 10. They then equalise among those aged 11 to 16, before becoming much more widespread among girls (23.9%) than boys (10.3%) aged 17 to 19.\n\nO\u2019Donnell said exams were fuelling the crisis, calling for an urgent change to how success is defined.\n\nComparing the UK with the Netherlands, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not a trade-off between that and traditional exams. The Netherlands is miles ahead of us on literacy, numeracy and science, and the same is true of Finland, where they start primary school later. We are getting something wrong.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Donnell, who served as Britain\u2019s most senior civil servant under Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron, also said he would be in favour of Ofsted measuring wellbeing.\n\n\u201cOfsted has become scary and very negative \u2026 I would like to find a way to make it more positive. Lots of things will affect a child\u2019s wellbeing, it\u2019s not just the school \u2013 not just a teacher \u2026 but on balance I would have Ofsted measuring that [wellbeing] and we\u2019d need to think very carefully \u2013 do pilot work on how to best to do that.\u201d\n\nHe also said mental health services were not good enough.\n\n\u201cCurrent provision is woefully inadequate, there is no question about that. We talk about equality between physical and mental health but we are miles away from it. There are plenty of people with diagnosed mental health issues having to wait far too long \u2026 We need more resources in this area,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.\n\n\u201cWe have brought forward a troubled generation and we will pay the price of some of the cutbacks we\u2019ve seen in mental health services and the reduction in benefits. Austerity will leave a mark, I am afraid.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Donnell said he knew people who had been through periods of poor mental health and had been touched by people who had killed themselves, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve seen the pain it causes and wonder: could more have been done to prevent that?\u201d\n\nHe also took aim at Brexit, saying it was \u201csucking the political oxygen out of everything\u201d.\n\nFifth of 17 to 19-year-old girls self-harm or attempt suicide Read more\n\n\u201cThere is no time for legislation because of what the house is up to all the time. Even if there had been clear long-term policy \u2013 and [Theresa] May suggested she was interested in the subject of children\u2019s mental health \u2013 nothing would happen,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said.\n\nDiscussing the role of civil servants in Britain\u2019s departure from the EU, he said: \u201cThey have done a really good job to help politicians get the best deal they could, given the way they decided to manage red lines and trade-offs.\n\n\u201cYou cannot help thinking it would have been good to have this debate about what particular Brexit do we want, either before the referendum, or if not then before triggering article 50, and it\u2019s a bit late now.\n\n\u201cThat is what has led us into this mess.

This is one of many things politicians deciding what to do need to be thinking about,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Thursday.\n\nShe added that the Met had set up an EU coordination unit, as reported in the Guardian. The aim of the unit is to help forces understand \u201chow to work most effectively across Europe to exit the EU under whatever circumstances\u201d.\n\nDick said: \u201cWe would hope that we have as much as possible the instruments we currently have or something similar, as quickly as possible, to keep the public safe.\n\n\u201cThe consequences of not having those things, and if there was [a] no-deal scenario, would be difficult in the short term.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether there was enough time to properly make replacements, Dick said: \u201cWe can talk about what might happen, but of course while there are so many unknowns, nothing can be put in place \u2026 But we can talk with colleagues and we are doing that all the time.\u201d", "List of BBC reporters in Russia leaked online along with their photos\n\nA list of BBC reporters working in Russia has been leaked online, along with their photographs, amid growing pressure on the broadcaster in Russia.\n\nThe list of 44 journalists, most of them Russian citizens, appears to have first been published in the anonymously run For Mother Russia group on the social network VKontakte. It was then reprinted by a rightwing Russian news website with photographs culled from the journalists\u2019 social media profiles and other public sources.\n\nThe independent TV Rain also reported a version of the list that had been released on the Russian site Pikabu, which resembles Reddit.\n\nThe leak of accredited journalists comes a week after Russia said it would launch an investigation into the BBC for violating fairness standards.\n\nKremlin officials said the investigation was a response to an Ofcom ruling that the state-backed RT (formerly Russia Today) had violated impartiality rules after the Salisbury poisoning incident and risked \u201cstatutory sanctions\u201d, including possible fines or a loss of licence.\n\nThe leak of BBC journalists also appears to be a retaliation. The Sunday Times last week published a list of names and photographs of eight reporters working for the Moscow-backed Sputnik\u2019s UK bureau in Edinburgh. Russian officials reacted angrily, saying the report put Sputnik\u2019s journalists in danger.\n\nA BBC spokesperson expressed frustration at the leak: \u201cThe BBC has strict editorial guidelines and has not published the details of journalists from other media organisations as there was no editorial reason or justification to do so. We are disappointed at the groundless publication of our Moscow team\u2019s details.\u201d\n\nIn a post accompanying the leak of BBC journalists, an anonymous administrator of the For Mother Russia Vkontakte group attacked the Sunday Times article for attempting to put \u201cpsychological pressure\u201d on Russian journalists.\n\nThe user then added: \u201cCombining several sources, we present you a list of fablers and dreamers from the Moscow bureau of the BBC.\u201d\n\nIt was not clear where the leak of Russian BBC reporters came from, although the information appears to have come from official documentation. The list only includes BBC employees accredited with the Russian government. The journalists are identified by their legal names, which in some cases differ from their bylines.\n\nMost of the 44 reporters are Russian citizens who work for the BBC World Service, which has expanded its operations in Russia significantly in the past two years, hiring some of the country\u2019s best journalistic talent.", "The seaside town of Ryde on the Isle of Wight, Smethwick in the West Midlands and Diss in Norfolk were the top towns for property growth in 2018, with prices up as much as 10% in a year when house price inflation across the UK fell to 1%.\n\nThe biggest price fall was in Alnwick, Northumberland, best known for its castle used as a location in the Harry Potter films, where values dropped by 6.6%. Biggleswade in Bedfordshire, Nantwich in Cheshire and Eastleigh in Hampshire all recorded price falls of 5% or more.\n\nThe figures were compiled by the property website Zoopla. In a relatively subdued year for the UK property market, it said prices nationally rose by an average of 1.02% during 2018.\n\nEven that relatively small increase added \u00a383bn to the total value of British residential property, which Zoopla estimated was worth \u00a38.29tn by the end of the year.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Housing in Smethwick, West Midlands, where prices rose 9.67%.

In England, prices crept ahead by 0.6% but the average is a much higher \u00a3325,839.\n\nThe property market has been dominated by Brexit fears in recent months, with most of the major house value indices showing flat or falling prices, particularly in London and the south.\n\nZoopla said there was an outright decline of 1.7% in London prices, while in the east of England prices also fell on average by 0.5% over the year.\n\nThe Brexit effect is even hitting house prices outside the UK, with it being blamed for Ireland\u2019s property market coming to a shuddering halt in the final quarter of 2018 as prices flatlined for the first time since the property crash of 2007-08.\n\nRichard Donnell of Zoopla said: \u201cThis latest analysis into the value of Britain\u2019s housing stock shows that while the overall value has grown by 1% this is slower than the 3.5% growth in 2017.\n\n\u201cThe slower growth is down to the value of housing falling in London and the east of England while values have increased across the rest of the country.

Yet the country moved this week to legalize medical marijuana \u2014 becoming the first nation in Southeast Asia to do so.\n\nThis week, Thailand\u2019s National Legislative Assembly, whose members are appointed by the country\u2019s ruling military junta, approved changes to the drug laws that legalize the use of cannabis for medicine and research. The vote was 166-0 in favor, with 13 members abstaining.

Patients approved to use the drug for medical purposes will need a prescription, and there will be limits to who can plant and sell it.

(Mark Schiefelbein/AP)\n\nFor more than 1,200 days, the Chinese government sought to build a case against Wang Quanzhang as it held him incommunicado in secret jails, denying him visits from his family and the lawyers he requested.\n\nOn the day of his trial, Wang struck back: He denied the government a quick verdict.\n\nA Chinese court in the city of Tianjin said Wednesday it held a hearing behind closed doors for Wang, one of the country\u2019s prominent civil rights lawyers, but could not immediately reveal the outcome because \u201cstate secrets were involved.\u201d\n\nThe real reason for the hiccup, Wang\u2019s supporters say, was more embarrassing for the authorities: Wang fired his government-appointed lawyer soon after his trial began, throwing a wrench into what were supposed to be swift and scripted proceedings.\n\nFour years after President Xi Jinping exhorted the Communist Party to strengthen the rule of law, international observers say the persecution of legal professionals like Wang shows the party-state moving in the other direction. In October, the United Nations Human Rights Council criticized Wang\u2019s detention and called for his release.\n\n\n\nThe story of his unusual day in court illustrates how the Communist Party uses layers of secrecy and a pliant court system to enforce its will \u2014 and how one individual, despite spending three years inside the state security apparatus, mounted a fleeting moment of resistance.\n\nFiring his lawyer \u201cwas his way to show defiance\u201d and \u201cnot let the Chinese Communist Party have its way,\u201d said Swedish human rights activist Peter Dahlin, a longtime friend and collaborator of Wang\u2019s. \u201cThe government tried to make this happen with minimal attention from diplomatic missions and the media,\u201d he added. \u201cObviously, this backfired spectacularly.\u201d\n\n\n\nWang, 42, attracted Beijing\u2019s ire by helping train and fund a grass-roots network of legal advocates with Dahlin in 2009 to organize lawsuits and protests to fight land grabs and police brutality. He was rounded up as part of what became known as the \u201c7-09 crackdown,\u201d when the government on July 9, 2015, seized more than 200 lawyers and activists in an unprecedented countrywide sweep to break up the movement.\n\n\n\nFor months, Wang disappeared into what is known as a black jail. When police notified Li Wenzu, his wife, that he was held for serious crimes, they would not disclose his location or details of his condition, citing national security. Since his arrest, seven different defense lawyers appointed by the family \u2014 as well as Li herself \u2014 have been denied visiting rights, she said. This summer, the authorities chose a lawyer to represent Wang.\n\n\u201cMy husband was always an innocent man,\u201d Li said. \u201cThey violated the law for so long, by illegally arresting him, by illegally detaining him for three and a half years, by illegally denying him lawyers, that now they\u2019re scared to have even an open court because it would expose the truth \u2014 that this is all illegal. That\u2019s why they choose this excuse that the case touches national security.\u201d\n\nArguing that the legal defense network was fanning popular unrest to destabilize the government, China systematically tried and sentenced more than a half-dozen of Wang\u2019s peers and associates to five to eight years on subversion-related charges. In show trials made for television, some defendants read from scripts. Other prosecutions turned on confessional interviews taped for the state broadcaster China Central Television. Dahlin, the Swede, was detained in early 2016 and released and deported after being forced to film a confession for CCTV.\n\nThat playbook did not work on Wang, the last holdout of the \u201c7-09\u201d detainees. To the outside world, at least, he did not give any indications that he was ready to cooperate with his prosecutors, and starting from dawn on Wednesday, neither did his supporters.\n\nAt 5 a.m., in a confrontation witnessed by reporters, a dozen plainclothes security agents blocked Li as she tried to leave her Beijing home to attend her husband\u2019s trial in Tianjin 80 miles away.\n\nBy afternoon, authorities had blocked Western diplomats from attending the hearing and intercepted activists who were traveling from remote provinces to voice support for Wang. Outside the courthouse, security forces also seized a demonstrator calling for free elections and Wang\u2019s release and stuffed him into a black vehicle while foreign news cameras rolled.\n\nPolice shove supporter Yang Chunlin into a black car after he shouted his support for Wang Quanzhang outside the Tianjin court #709\u738b\u5168\u748b\u6848 pic.twitter.com/0474JP46wu \u2014 Pak Yiu (@pakwayne) December 26, 2018\n\nBy evening, word emerged that a decision would be pushed back, without clear signals that the trial had wrapped up. In a text message seen by The Washington Post, Wang\u2019s government-appointed lawyer Liu Weiguo told friends he did not know the hearing\u2019s outcome because his client had dismissed him within the first minute of the trial. Liu could not be reached for comment.\n\n\u201cThis was the most bizarre form of a show trial imaginable, where they couldn\u2019t even put on a show,\u201d said Jerome A. Cohen, an expert on Chinese law at New York University. Time and again, the authorities\u2019 fixation on secrecy, Cohen said, showed \u201cinsecurity, not strength.\u201d\n\n\n\nStill, in a country where the government wins more than 99 percent of the time in court and failed prosecutions are unheard of in high-profile political cases, Wang will be made to pay. Few among his supporters believe he can escape a heavy sentence, much less walk free.\n\n\n\nMoreover, human rights groups say his resistance for three years behind bars may have taken an untold psychological and physical toll. And it may land him a harsher verdict in a court system in which a suspect\u2019s attitude \u2014 submission or defiance \u2014 can outweigh guilt or innocence.\n\n\u201cWang may not have bought into the \u2018confessing in exchange for leniency\u2019 tactic, and that\u2019s why he has been detained for so long,\u201d said Doriane Lau, a China researcher at Amnesty International.\n\nUnder Chinese law, suspects in political cases can be held at undisclosed locations for six months as state security officials gather evidence \u2014 or, as is often the case, extract a confession.\n\n\u201cIn this case, we think there was a problem where prosecutors couldn\u2019t get what they wanted,\u201d said Lau.\n\n\n\nIn the case of Wu Gan, a blogger associated with the lawyers\u2019 movement, police detained his parents to force their son to confess in court or on camera. Wu refused and was tried on Christmas Day 2017 in a closed courtroom, where he received an eight-year sentence.\n\nOutside the murky justice system , Wang\u2019s young family has also borne the toll of his detention.\n\nSince 2016, Li and the couple\u2019s young son have been under constant surveillance, with state security at one point moving into an apartment in her building and in another instance driving her out of her rental home.\n\n\n\nBut Li and other wives of detained \u201c7-09\u201d lawyers have become savvy media campaigners who strike a rare balance of staging publicity stunts that Chinese authorities appear to loathe, yet generally treat with a light touch.\n\nIn April, Li and her friends walked 60 miles to Tianjin to demand answers about her locked-up husband before being turned back. A month later, German Chancellor Angela Merkel invited her to a meeting during a trip to Beijing as a gesture of support.\n\n\n\nWith no end to her husband\u2019s ordeal in sight, Li said she would continue to demand access to his court hearings or to visit. She intends to demonstrate outside the Supreme People\u2019s Court in Beijing if Wang\u2019s case continues to stall, she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a wife, I have the right to know the truth,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the authorities tell me I cannot know this, or I cannot go there, they never can provide reasons. They just use the logic of having more power or more bodies to stop me.\n\n\u201cAll I can do is persist,\u201d she said. \u201cI will persist until I cannot anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nWe don\u2019t even know if this heroic Chinese lawyer is dead or alive\n\n\n\nChina jails yet another human rights lawyer in ongoing campaign against dissent\n\n\n\nJailed Chinese lawyer delivers \u201cconfession,\u201d but the script seems familiar\n\n\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "People search among debris in an area affected by a tsunami in Labuhan, Banten province, Indonesia, on Dec. 27.

(Christopher Morris/VII/Redux)\n\nWhen French politician Marine Le Pen needed cash for her far-right party, an obscure Russian bank agreed to help.\n\nFour years later, the bank has gone bust. The owner is facing a warrant for his arrest. Former Russian military officers are demanding money. And the party\u2019s treasurer is sending off some $165,000 every few months to a woman in Moscow, unsure of where the payments ultimately will go.\n\nThe money failed to deliver Le Pen the French presidency in last year\u2019s election, denying the Kremlin a powerful ally in the heart of Europe. Instead, the 9.4 million-euro loan, then worth $12.2 million, dragged her party into the shadowy underworld of Russian cross-border finance, putting it in league with people accused of having ties to Russian organized crime, money laundering and military operations.\n\nThe mysterious saga of the loan offers a rare look inside the Russian influence engine, demonstrating how people, companies and networks outside the Kremlin pursue President Vladimir Putin\u2019s foreign policy aims, often without a centralized plan.\n\n\n\nPOWER PLOYS | Understanding Russia\u2019s global influence\n\n\u201cIt was in the interest of Russia to support Marine Le Pen,\u201d said Aymeric Chauprade, a member of the European Parliament who advised Le Pen on foreign policy before leaving her party. \u201cEvery time you have a political leader who says we should change our policy regarding Russia . . . they are interested in supporting him.\u201d\n\nAfter Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election, the intelligence community concluded that Putin himself had signed off on \u201cactive measures\u201d to bolster Donald Trump. The assessment added to a perception in the United States and beyond that the Russian president personally orchestrates all of Moscow\u2019s covert operations.\n\nBut Moscow\u2019s foreign influence efforts also bubble up from below, or percolate on the margins, with power brokers offering support to Kremlin sympathizers abroad in ways that do not always require Putin\u2019s upfront blessing.\n\nThe Le Pen loan, analysts say, is an example of how it works. After Putin sets out the vision, agents inside and outside the government begin executing it, hoping to score points with him if their gambits succeed.\n\nThe money is also perhaps the best evidence in recent years that Russian influence operations abroad involve not only Internet trolling and military adventurism but secretive financing as well.\n\nThe network that facilitated the deal, according to Joshua Kirschenbaum, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund\u2019s Alliance for Securing Democracy \u2014 which has authored a study on the loan along with the Washington think tank C4ADS \u2014 is \u201cthe purest distillation of how illicit finance intersects with foreign interference.\u201d\n\nFinancial needs\n\nLike most loans, the one Le Pen\u2019s party took out in 2014 began with a need for cash.\n\nAt the time, Le Pen\u2019s modern touches were breathing momentum into a far-right movement started decades earlier by her father and known for its anti-Semitic and xenophobic views. Le Pen presented a cleaned-up version of the party\u2019s politics, deftly mixing calls to pull France out of NATO and possibly the European Union with broadsides against immigration and Islam.\n\nBut the party, then known as the National Front and now called the National Rally, was having difficulty securing credit from traditional French banks. Le Pen accused the banks of discrimination for refusing to offer a loan.\n\nIn search of money from a non-French bank, party officials turned to Jean-Luc Schaffhauser, a member of the European Parliament elected as part of Le Pen\u2019s party bloc.\n\nFor years, Schaffhauser wanted to build an alliance between Europe and Russia to act, he said, as a Christian bulwark against Asia and the Middle East. In between working as an international consultant for French oil and aerospace firms, he said, he dreamed of one day running a pro-Russian foundation that would distribute Russian money to organizations in Europe and drive the continent closer to Moscow.\n\nThrough what he described as work on a French-Russian development-bank project in 2004 or 2005, Schaffhauser said he met a Russian businessman and member of parliament named Alexander Babakov, who in 2012 became the Kremlin\u2019s special envoy for Russian organizations abroad.\n\nSchaffhauser, looking for a loan for Le Pen, said he reconnected with Babakov through a mutual contact in the Russian Orthodox Church and arranged a meeting in mid-2014.\n\n\u201cIt was face-to-face,\u201d Schaffhauser recalled, speaking English in an interview. \u201cHe says he has a possibility.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cpossibility\u201d Babakov proposed, according to Schaffhauser, was a loan from the First Czech-Russian Bank. Through a spokeswoman, Babakov declined to comment for this report.\n\n\n\nA branch of First Czech-Russian Bank in Moscow in 2016. (Dmitry Serebryakov/Tass/Alamy Live News)\n\n'For me, it was safe'\n\nFirst Czech started out as a joint venture between a Czech state bank and a Russian lender. In the early 2000s, it became part of a Russian pipeline construction company that was subsequently acquired by the firm of a billionaire friend of Putin\u2019s, Gennady Timchenko.\n\nThe bank spun out on its own under the personal ownership of one of the pipeline company\u2019s executives, a Russian financier named Roman Popov. A subsidiary of the bank secured a European license in the Czech Republic.\n\nFor Schaffhauser, the bank\u2019s European license was a green light for the party, despite some questions about its lending practices. Popov had been facilitating transactions in Iran and working with a businessman the U.S. Treasury Department recently hit with sanctions for allegedly being an \u201coverseer\u201d in a Russian organized-crime syndicate.\n\nWhen asked whether the party was suspicious of the bank\u2019s activities, Schaffhauser cited the European license and said, \u201cFor me, it was safe.\u201d\n\n\n\nJean-Luc Schaffhauser is interviewed in Strasbourg in 2014.

His fee was deposited in what he described as a family foundation. He said people close to Babakov, the Russian member of parliament and special envoy, also discussed investing in his think tank.\n\nAt the same time, Schaffhauser was railing against sanctions imposed on Russia and promoting other pro-Russian positions in the European Parliament.

Among them \u2014 the loan extended to Le Pen\u2019s party.\n\nElvira Nabiullina, the head of the Russian Central Bank, was leading a broad crackdown on questionable banks, many of which had become playthings for Russian businessmen, mob bosses and politicians.\n\nWith backing from Putin, she began closing banks with bad loans and insufficient reserves that threatened Russia\u2019s economic stability. The effort shut down nearly 100 financial institutions by the end of 2016.\n\nRussian regulators described First Czech\u2019s assets as low-quality, saying the company had made loans to shell companies in excess of 19.2 billion rubles, or $277 million at the time. They placed the distressed bank under the management of provisional administrators.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut as they seized the company, regulators said they encountered serious obstruction, with bank officials concealing asset withdrawals.\n\nWithin months, the bank had lost its Russian license, and later it was formally declared insolvent. Czech regulators later pulled the European license, too.\n\nBy then, Le Pen\u2019s loan had disappeared from the books.\n\nSome six days before Russian regulators placed the bank in the hands of the provisional administrators, First Czech sold the loan to an obscure Russian company that corporate registration records describe as a machinery and equipment rental company.\n\nThe loan didn\u2019t stay there for long.\n\nAt the end of 2016, it was transferred to a Moscow-based aircraft supply company called Aviazapchast, according to Russia\u2019s deposit insurance agency.\n\nA private company, Aviazapchast grew out of the foreign sales arm of the Soviet aviation ministry, which repaired and replaced plane and helicopter equipment that the Soviet Union sold abroad. Among its clients today is the Syrian air force, which human rights groups have accused of committing atrocities against civilians by dropping barrel bombs for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nThe company is deeply intertwined with the Russian military. Three of the four executives listed on its website spent decades in the Soviet and Russian armed forces. The company holds a government-secrets license from Russia\u2019s FSB security service.\n\nThe No. 2 executive on the leadership team listed on the company\u2019s website is Yevgeny Barmyantsev, a retired military officer who served as an attache at the Soviet Embassy in Washington. In 1983, as a 39-year-old Soviet military spy, he was expelled from the United States after federal agents caught him retrieving documents from the base of a tree in Maryland.\n\nWhy Aviazapchast acquired the Le Pen loan is unclear. The company\u2019s owner is a Russian businessman, Valery Zakharenkov, who, according to filings for another company he controls, keeps an apartment near the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.\n\n\n\nLe Pen at the close of the 2014 National Front congress in Lyon.

The agency said the assets should go to the Russian financial authorities that seized the bank.\n\nLe Pen\u2019s party agrees.\n\n\u201cWhen a commercial company is liquidated, no one can take an asset out and dispose of it. This can only be done by the person in charge of the liquidation,\u201d said de Saint Just, the party\u2019s treasurer. \u201cSince it wasn\u2019t done by the person in charge of the liquidation and this was a person we didn\u2019t know at all, we obviously refused.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he added, \u201cwe found it a little odd that this should be handed to a company that sells equipment to planes.\u201d\n\nDe Saint Just said that when Aviazapchast tried to collect interest payments, he contacted Russian authorities.\n\nFor now, he says he is sending interest payments to a notary in Moscow named Ms. Romanova, who will hold the cash until a final Russian court ruling indicates where the money should go. He declined to provide evidence of the payments.\n\nAsked whether Aviazapchast had links to Russian military intelligence, de Saint Just waved his hand in dismissal.\n\n\u201cIn Russia, they\u2019re all former members of the KGB,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of them.\u201d\n\nAviazapchast declined to comment.\n\nEarlier this year, Moscow\u2019s arbitration court ruled that Aviazapchast was in fact the rightful owner of the loan. But Russian regulators have appealed, according to the deposit insurance agency. An official there said the next hearing is in February.\n\nWhile Russian regulators attempt to recover the assets First Czech sold before its collapse, criminal prosecutors in Moscow have been pursuing the bank\u2019s managers and owners, including Popov.\n\nRussian police arrested a senior vice president of the bank who worked there for only two weeks and oversaw the asset sales, accusing him of financial fraud in an ongoing criminal case. He has denied wrongdoing. In April, Russian authorities issued an international arrest warrant for Popov and his deputy on accusations of large-scale embezzlement.\n\nAn attorney for Popov said that the case remained open and that his client was not in Russia. He did not say where he is. Another attorney for the firm said Popov has denied wrongdoing in the proceedings. Popov could not be reached for comment.\n\nDespite all that has transpired with the loan, de Saint Just said he would do it again under similar circumstances.\n\n\u201cIf I could, I would have seen Mr. Popov again to tell him things had worked well the last time and ask him to loan us money again,\u201d de Saint Just said in an interview in his Paris office, where he sat under a poster of Le Pen. \u201cBut the bank was shut down. It\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nDe Saint Just said he has a phone number only for the bank\u2019s administrative director, who he said was laid off as the bank collapsed.\n\n\u201cI hope she found a job,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause she was very pretty and very competent.\u201d\n\n\n\nMarine Le Pen at a rally in rural Brachay, a bastion of National Front support, in 2014.

What is unclear is how often they do so, given that few such transactions have been exposed and political parties rarely receive formal loans from foreign banks.\n\nMoscow did not regard the loan as successful, particularly after Le Pen lost the presidency, said Mark Galeotti, an expert in Russian security affairs and a fellow at the European University Institute in Florence. He said Russia is now more likely to use smaller amounts of untraceable \u201cblack cash\u201d in financial influence operations.\n\nThe story of the loan agreement again demonstrates how Russia is not the \u201ckind of ruthlessly disciplined, lockstep state\u201d many have imagined, Galeotti added.\n\n\u201cMost of these things are experimental,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Russians have no standard playbook. They just try things and see what works.\u201d\n\n\n\nLe Pen campaign materials on display in Brachay, France, in 2014.

The unannounced journey took place just days after he declared that he planned to remove U.S. troops from Syria and saw his own defense secretary resign in response.\n\nIn April 2009, Trump\u2019s predecessor in the Oval Office, President Barack Obama, made his own trip to Iraq to visit U.S. military personnel.

This itself is a reflection of the different personalities of the two men as commanders in chief, as well as the dramatic changes that have taken place in the Middle East in the past nine years.\n\nDespite frequent praise for the U.S. military and the appointment of military leaders to Cabinet positions, it took Trump almost half of his first term as president to visit U.S. soldiers in a conflict zone.\n\n[Trump\u2019s Iraq visit prompts concern over operational security]\n\nIn contrast, Obama\u2019s trip to Iraq took place less than three months after he was inaugurated. He would go on to visit another conflict zone, Afghanistan, twice in his second year in office. Obama\u2019s own predecessor, President George W. Bush, had also visited Iraq less than a year after the U.S.-led invasion of the country began in March 2003.\n\nLike Obama\u2019s visit, Trump\u2019s trip to Iraq was not announced publicly beforehand \u2014 a reflection of the security concerns that have not abated much between 2009 and now. Both visited U.S. troops in the country, with Obama meeting them inside a palace built by Saddam Hussein in Baghdad, while Trump visited an air base. Neither president spent more than a few hours inside Iraq.\n\nHowever, Obama met with Iraq\u2019s leader at the time, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, at Camp Victory while he was in Iraq. Trump did not meet Iraq\u2019s current leader, Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi. Iraqi lawmakers said there was a disagreement over whether to meet at the air base, as the U.S. side wished.\n\nSome Iraqi politicians have criticized Trump\u2019s visit to Iraq and described it as a violation of Iraqi sovereignty. \u201cThe U.S. occupation of Iraq is over,\u201d Sabah al Saadi, the leader of the Islah parliamentary bloc, said in a statement.\n\nCertainly, the Iraq that Trump is visiting is in a very different neighborhood than the one that Obama visited in 2009. In 2009, there were no U.S. troops in Syria to withdraw \u2014 indeed, that country had not yet started on the path of the civil war that has killed over half a million people since 2011. Obama himself had not yet helped reach the nuclear deal between Iraq\u2019s neighbor Iran and other world powers in 2015, while Saudi Arabia had not begun the complicated changes that were kicked off by King Abdullah\u2019s death in 2015.\n\nWhen Obama visited in 2009, the United States still had a huge military presence in Iraq itself: There were roughly 157,800 U.S. military personnel in the country during the 2008 fiscal year. During his visit, Obama reiterated his intention to remove all U.S. troops from the country.\n\n\u201cUnder enormous strain and under enormous sacrifice, through controversy and difficulty and politics, you\u2019ve kept your eyes focused on just doing your jobs,\u201d Obama told the troops in 2009. \u201cYou have given Iraq the opportunity to stand on its own as a democratic country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey need to take responsibility for their country and for their sovereignty,\u201d Obama said of the Iraqi government.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump talks to members of the military at a dining hall at al-Asad Air Base. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nObama followed through on his pledges in 2011, withdrawing U.S. soldiers from Iraq. However, U.S. troops returned in 2014 in response to a request from the Iraqi government to help in the fight against the Islamic State, an extremist group that had previously been called al-Qaeda in Iraq and was known as the Islamic State of Iraq when Obama visited in 2009.\n\nThe year after Obama visited Iraq, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was installed as its leader. He would go on to lead the extremist group to expand into Syria, eventually leading the United States to send troops to that country, where they have been working with local forces since 2015.\n\nLast week, Trump announced that these soldiers would be coming home, as the Islamic State was defeated. \u201cOur boys, our young women, our men, they\u2019re all coming back, and they\u2019re coming back now. We won,\u201d Trump said in a video message on Twitter. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis announced his resignation soon afterward.\n\nBut as he visited Iraq on Wednesday, Trump had a very different message \u2014 again, a real contrast to Obama\u2019s message nine years before \u2014 for the roughly 5,200 U.S. troops deployed in Iraq. The message was that this time, there was no immediate plan to withdraw U.S. soldiers from Iraq. \u201cIn fact, we could use this as the base if we wanted to do something in Syria,\u201d the U.S. leader added.", "President Trump\u2019s surprise meeting with U.S. troops stationed in Iraq on Wednesday may have pleased critics who had long called for such a visit. But outside al-Asad Air Base west of Baghdad, reactions were overwhelmingly negative. Several Iraqi political leaders portrayed Trump\u2019s unannounced visit as a violation of the country\u2019s sovereignty, and at least one parliamentary bloc called for an emergency parliamentary session Thursday.\n\nAs Iraqi discontent was mounting, Trump had already arrived at his next stop on the way back home: the Ramstein U.S. military base in southern Germany.\n\nTrump met with neither German Chancellor Angela Merkel nor Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi on this trip. And yet, as of Thursday morning, German officials had not echoed the complaints of their Iraqi counterparts.\n\nSo why did Trump\u2019s troop visits disgruntle one country while apparently going almost unnoticed in the other?\n\nAt least some of the Iraqi discontent appears to be a result of the way the U.S. government set up Trump\u2019s visit. According to my colleagues, the Iraqi prime minister refused to meet Trump at al-Asad Air Base after not being given notice. Instead, the two leaders talked on the phone, but that did not stop Iraqi critics of the U.S. military presence there from lashing out at Trump, accusing him of disrespecting the country\u2019s leadership and norms.\n\nWhile U.S. involvement in the fight against the Islamic State has been credited with speeding up the group\u2019s retreat, recent U.S. airstrikes on Iraqi cities such as Mosul have been strongly criticized by human rights groups and some Iraqi politicians. U.S. strikes caused scores of civilian casualties, which are now being cited by those campaigning to kick all remaining U.S. service members out of the country. Amid those tensions, Trump\u2019s not-so-diplomatic visit reinforced a perception that the United States is behaving as if it is still occupying Iraq.\n\n\u201cVisiting a military base in Iraq and not meeting any Iraqi officials is a good way to increase the risks that we don\u2019t have much of a military presence at all in Iraq for very long,\u201d said a senior anti-Islamic State coalition official, who did not want to be named. The official went on to describe the decision as \u201ctone-deaf\u201d and said it \u201csuggests they do not even understand the basis on which we have a coalition military presence in Iraq. It\u2019s all entirely with the consent of the Iraqi government.\u201d\n\n\n\nAn Iraqi man uses an excavator on the ruins of a building as people start to rebuild their houses in the old city of Mosul on Dec. 23. (Ahmad al-Rubaye/AFP/Getty Images) (Ahmad Al-Rubaye/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nU.S. troops can be in Iraq legally only as long as the Iraqi government requests their support. When President George W. Bush moved to withdraw U.S. combat troops from the country, Iraq and the United States in 2008 reached a broad security agreement that gave U.S. service members immunity from Iraqi jurisdiction and other powers.\n\nThat agreement expired Dec. 31, 2011, and contrary to U.S. optimism that a new, similar arrangement would be approved by the Iraqi parliament to keep some U.S. combat troops in the country, the Iraqis refused to accept the standard U.S. terms regarding legal protections for U.S. service members. As a way out of the dilemma, the Iraqi prime minister offered President Barack Obama assurances without parliamentary approval, but the Obama administration argued that parliamentary approval was crucial. Amid fears that U.S. troops could end up being tried in Iraqi courts, Obama decided to withdraw all remaining troops in accordance with the agreement reached under the Bush administration.\n\nBut three years later, amid the rapid ascent of the Islamic State militant group, the U.S. president accepted the same assurances that the Iraqis had offered U.S. forces in 2011. This time, Obama accepted the diplomatic notes that had previously been considered too volatile, and U.S. soldiers returned to Iraq.\n\nExecutive assurances provided without the approval of parliament are still the legal basis for the U.S. presence in Iraq, apart from a Strategic Framework Agreement from 2008, and that is unlikely to change with a U.S. president more interested in winding down rather than expanding operations. Any draft deal could also be derailed by the Iraqi side, which U.S. officials have recently accused of turning a blind eye to the proliferation of forces aligned with neighboring Iran.\n\nTrump said during his visit to al-Asad Air Base on Wednesday that he would keep U.S. troops in Iraq, from where they could potentially reenter Syria in case the Islamic State gains new traction. But legally, that is not up to the U.S. president to decide.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump is seen through camouflage netting as he speaks at a rally at al-Asad Air Base in Iraq on Dec. 26. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nNegotiations on a longer-term U.S.-Iraqi military agreement, reported last spring, so far do not appear to have resulted in a breakthrough. The absence of a deal has made the U.S. government more vulnerable to accusations of violating Iraqi sovereignty, and Trump\u2019s Wednesday visit showed that the perceived legal gray zone could also play into the hands of leaders opposed to U.S. interests.\n\nIn Germany, where 42 percent of respondents said in a survey this summer that U.S. troops should leave the country, Trump\u2019s brief stop was perceived with fewer suspicions Thursday. For anyone with questions about why more than 30,000 U.S. troops are still based in the country, the German government has an explainer at hand on the complex web of agreements struck among Germany, the United States and other NATO partners in recent decades.\n\nThe Germans have a name for that kind of agreement: Truppenstationierungsrecht, meaning law governing the stationing of troops. Trump and the German government might disagree on multiple fronts, but Germany\u2019s Truppenstationierungsrecht and its diplomatic law and norms offered some clear guidance this week: The U.S. commander in chief may visit his troops whenever he likes.\n\nTamer El-Ghobashy contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump visits U.S. troops in Iraq for first trip to a conflict zone\n\nTrump\u2019s Iraq visit prompts concern over operational security\n\nU.S. forces will stay in Iraq and could reenter Syria from there, Trump says", "Plainclothes security officers take away a supporter of Chinese human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang near the Secondary Intermediate People's Court of Tianjin in northeastern China's Tianjin municipality, on Wednesday. (Mark Schiefelbein/AP)\n\nFor more than 1,200 days, the Chinese government sought to build a case against Wang Quanzhang as it held him incommunicado in secret jails, denying him visits from his family and the lawyers he requested.\n\nOn the day of his trial, Wang struck back: He denied the government a quick verdict.\n\nA Chinese court in the city of Tianjin said Wednesday it held a hearing behind closed doors for Wang, one of the country\u2019s prominent civil rights lawyers, but could not immediately reveal the outcome because \u201cstate secrets were involved.\u201d\n\nThe real reason for the hiccup, Wang\u2019s supporters say, was more embarrassing for the authorities: Wang fired his government-appointed lawyer soon after his trial began, throwing a wrench into what were supposed to be swift and scripted proceedings.\n\nFour years after President Xi Jinping exhorted the Communist Party to strengthen the rule of law, international observers say the persecution of legal professionals like Wang shows the party-state moving in the other direction. In October, the United Nations Human Rights Council criticized Wang\u2019s detention and called for his release.\n\n\n\nThe story of his unusual day in court illustrates how the Communist Party uses layers of secrecy and a pliant court system to enforce its will \u2014 and how one individual, despite spending three years inside the state security apparatus, mounted a fleeting moment of resistance.\n\nFiring his lawyer \u201cwas his way to show defiance\u201d and \u201cnot let the Chinese Communist Party have its way,\u201d said Swedish human rights activist Peter Dahlin, a longtime friend and collaborator of Wang\u2019s. \u201cThe government tried to make this happen with minimal attention from diplomatic missions and the media,\u201d he added. \u201cObviously, this backfired spectacularly.\u201d\n\n\n\nWang, 42, attracted Beijing\u2019s ire by helping train and fund a grass-roots network of legal advocates with Dahlin in 2009 to organize lawsuits and protests to fight land grabs and police brutality. He was rounded up as part of what became known as the \u201c7-09 crackdown,\u201d when the government on July 9, 2015, seized more than 200 lawyers and activists in an unprecedented countrywide sweep to break up the movement.\n\n\n\nFor months, Wang disappeared into what is known as a black jail. When police notified Li Wenzu, his wife, that he was held for serious crimes, they would not disclose his location or details of his condition, citing national security. Since his arrest, seven different defense lawyers appointed by the family \u2014 as well as Li herself \u2014 have been denied visiting rights, she said. This summer, the authorities chose a lawyer to represent Wang.\n\n\u201cMy husband was always an innocent man,\u201d Li said. \u201cThey violated the law for so long, by illegally arresting him, by illegally detaining him for three and a half years, by illegally denying him lawyers, that now they\u2019re scared to have even an open court because it would expose the truth \u2014 that this is all illegal. That\u2019s why they choose this excuse that the case touches national security.\u201d\n\nArguing that the legal defense network was fanning popular unrest to destabilize the government, China systematically tried and sentenced more than a half-dozen of Wang\u2019s peers and associates to five to eight years on subversion-related charges. In show trials made for television, some defendants read from scripts. Other prosecutions turned on confessional interviews taped for the state broadcaster China Central Television. Dahlin, the Swede, was detained in early 2016 and released and deported after being forced to film a confession for CCTV.\n\nThat playbook did not work on Wang, the last holdout of the \u201c7-09\u201d detainees. To the outside world, at least, he did not give any indications that he was ready to cooperate with his prosecutors, and starting from dawn on Wednesday, neither did his supporters.\n\nAt 5 a.m., in a confrontation witnessed by reporters, a dozen plainclothes security agents blocked Li as she tried to leave her Beijing home to attend her husband\u2019s trial in Tianjin 80 miles away.\n\nBy afternoon, authorities had blocked Western diplomats from attending the hearing and intercepted activists who were traveling from remote provinces to voice support for Wang. Outside the courthouse, security forces also seized a demonstrator calling for free elections and Wang\u2019s release and stuffed him into a black vehicle while foreign news cameras rolled.\n\nPolice shove supporter Yang Chunlin into a black car after he shouted his support for Wang Quanzhang outside the Tianjin court #709\u738b\u5168\u748b\u6848 pic.twitter.com/0474JP46wu \u2014 Pak Yiu (@pakwayne) December 26, 2018\n\nBy evening, word emerged that a decision would be pushed back, without clear signals that the trial had wrapped up. In a text message seen by The Washington Post, Wang\u2019s government-appointed lawyer Liu Weiguo told friends he did not know the hearing\u2019s outcome because his client had dismissed him within the first minute of the trial. Liu could not be reached for comment.\n\n\u201cThis was the most bizarre form of a show trial imaginable, where they couldn\u2019t even put on a show,\u201d said Jerome A. Cohen, an expert on Chinese law at New York University. Time and again, the authorities\u2019 fixation on secrecy, Cohen said, showed \u201cinsecurity, not strength.\u201d\n\n\n\nStill, in a country where the government wins more than 99 percent of the time in court and failed prosecutions are unheard of in high-profile political cases, Wang will be made to pay. Few among his supporters believe he can escape a heavy sentence, much less walk free.\n\n\n\nMoreover, human rights groups say his resistance for three years behind bars may have taken an untold psychological and physical toll. And it may land him a harsher verdict in a court system in which a suspect\u2019s attitude \u2014 submission or defiance \u2014 can outweigh guilt or innocence.\n\n\u201cWang may not have bought into the \u2018confessing in exchange for leniency\u2019 tactic, and that\u2019s why he has been detained for so long,\u201d said Doriane Lau, a China researcher at Amnesty International.\n\nUnder Chinese law, suspects in political cases can be held at undisclosed locations for six months as state security officials gather evidence \u2014 or, as is often the case, extract a confession.\n\n\u201cIn this case, we think there was a problem where prosecutors couldn\u2019t get what they wanted,\u201d said Lau.\n\n\n\nIn the case of Wu Gan, a blogger associated with the lawyers\u2019 movement, police detained his parents to force their son to confess in court or on camera. Wu refused and was tried on Christmas Day 2017 in a closed courtroom, where he received an eight-year sentence.\n\nOutside the murky justice system , Wang\u2019s young family has also borne the toll of his detention.\n\nSince 2016, Li and the couple\u2019s young son have been under constant surveillance, with state security at one point moving into an apartment in her building and in another instance driving her out of her rental home.\n\n\n\nBut Li and other wives of detained \u201c7-09\u201d lawyers have become savvy media campaigners who strike a rare balance of staging publicity stunts that Chinese authorities appear to loathe, yet generally treat with a light touch.\n\nIn April, Li and her friends walked 60 miles to Tianjin to demand answers about her locked-up husband before being turned back. A month later, German Chancellor Angela Merkel invited her to a meeting during a trip to Beijing as a gesture of support.\n\n\n\nWith no end to her husband\u2019s ordeal in sight, Li said she would continue to demand access to his court hearings or to visit. She intends to demonstrate outside the Supreme People\u2019s Court in Beijing if Wang\u2019s case continues to stall, she said.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a wife, I have the right to know the truth,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen the authorities tell me I cannot know this, or I cannot go there, they never can provide reasons. They just use the logic of having more power or more bodies to stop me.\n\n\u201cAll I can do is persist,\u201d she said. \u201cI will persist until I cannot anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\nRead more:\n\nWe don\u2019t even know if this heroic Chinese lawyer is dead or alive\n\n\n\nChina jails yet another human rights lawyer in ongoing campaign against dissent\n\n\n\nJailed Chinese lawyer delivers \u201cconfession,\u201d but the script seems familiar\n\n\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "President Trump made his first visit to a conflict zone as commander in chief this week, visiting troops at al-Asad Air Base in western Iraq on Wednesday.

Iraqi lawmakers said there was a disagreement over whether to meet at the air base, as the U.S. side wished.\n\nSome Iraqi politicians have criticized Trump\u2019s visit to Iraq and described it as a violation of Iraqi sovereignty. \u201cThe U.S. occupation of Iraq is over,\u201d Sabah al Saadi, the leader of the Islah parliamentary bloc, said in a statement.\n\nCertainly, the Iraq that Trump is visiting is in a very different neighborhood than the one that Obama visited in 2009. In 2009, there were no U.S. troops in Syria to withdraw \u2014 indeed, that country had not yet started on the path of the civil war that has killed over half a million people since 2011. Obama himself had not yet helped reach the nuclear deal between Iraq\u2019s neighbor Iran and other world powers in 2015, while Saudi Arabia had not begun the complicated changes that were kicked off by King Abdullah\u2019s death in 2015.\n\nWhen Obama visited in 2009, the United States still had a huge military presence in Iraq itself: There were roughly 157,800 U.S. military personnel in the country during the 2008 fiscal year. During his visit, Obama reiterated his intention to remove all U.S. troops from the country.\n\n\u201cUnder enormous strain and under enormous sacrifice, through controversy and difficulty and politics, you\u2019ve kept your eyes focused on just doing your jobs,\u201d Obama told the troops in 2009. \u201cYou have given Iraq the opportunity to stand on its own as a democratic country.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey need to take responsibility for their country and for their sovereignty,\u201d Obama said of the Iraqi government.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump talks to members of the military at a dining hall at al-Asad Air Base. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nObama followed through on his pledges in 2011, withdrawing U.S. soldiers from Iraq. However, U.S. troops returned in 2014 in response to a request from the Iraqi government to help in the fight against the Islamic State, an extremist group that had previously been called al-Qaeda in Iraq and was known as the Islamic State of Iraq when Obama visited in 2009.\n\nThe year after Obama visited Iraq, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was installed as its leader. He would go on to lead the extremist group to expand into Syria, eventually leading the United States to send troops to that country, where they have been working with local forces since 2015.\n\nLast week, Trump announced that these soldiers would be coming home, as the Islamic State was defeated. \u201cOur boys, our young women, our men, they\u2019re all coming back, and they\u2019re coming back now. We won,\u201d Trump said in a video message on Twitter. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis announced his resignation soon afterward.\n\nBut as he visited Iraq on Wednesday, Trump had a very different message \u2014 again, a real contrast to Obama\u2019s message nine years before \u2014 for the roughly 5,200 U.S. troops deployed in Iraq. The message was that this time, there was no immediate plan to withdraw U.S. soldiers from Iraq. \u201cIn fact, we could use this as the base if we wanted to do something in Syria,\u201d the U.S. leader added."], "grade": -10}}
